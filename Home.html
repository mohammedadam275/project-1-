    <h2>Protein</h2>

    <h2>Fats</h2>
    <p>Fats are a concentrated source of energy and play a crucial role in hormone production, cell structure, and the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). They also provide insulation and protection for organs. Fats can be classified into saturated and unsaturated fats.</p>
